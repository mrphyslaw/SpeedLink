# SpeedLink

Open-source ROM reading, data logging and offline ROM editing for Mazdaspeed and Mazda MPS.

[![C# checks](https://github.com/mrphyslaw/SpeedLink/actions/workflows/checks-dotnet.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mrphyslaw/SpeedLink/actions/workflows/checks-dotnet.yml)

**[Download v0.6.0-alpha.5](https://github.com/mrphyslaw/SpeedLink/releases/tag/v0.6.0-alpha.5)** — a single Windows EXE, with no installer or .NET installation required.

This release fixes the blank editor caused by a hidden map browser. Opening a ROM now shows its maps, a permanent **Maps** button restores the browser, and a clear selection prompt replaces the empty grid. Replace the EXE and keep your existing `data` folder. See [maintenance](docs/MAINTENANCE.md) and [reporting problems](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

SpeedLink can dump unknown 1 MiB MZR DISI ROMs, create two-pass verified backups,
log stock-ECU data, review recordings and edit the nine supported stock ROM layouts.
ECU access remains read-only: **flashing is disabled**. ROM files and adapter drivers
are not bundled. Real Mazda ECU validation remains pending.

**Experimental Gen 2:** L3CGEE000 adds 442 editor controls and a 20-parameter
stock-ROM logger. Compatible unknown Gen 2 ROMs can be dumped by selecting the
Gen 2 read protocol. Real ECU validation is pending; see the [Gen 2 guide](docs/GEN2.md).

## A look inside

### ROM editor

[![SpeedLink alpha.9 editor showing an intake cam advance table with labeled axes and a compact 3D preview](docs/editor/images/workspace-alpha9.png)](docs/editor/README.md)

Browse related maps, edit the grid, compare values and inspect 2D curves or
rotatable 3D surfaces. [More editor screenshots and a first-edit walkthrough →](docs/editor/README.md)
Axis headers have a distinct background and bright separators. **Map info**
beside the tabs, or **F1**, shows units, correction direction and practical examples.
The preview shows the v0.5.4-alpha.9 app with an L38KEH000 VVT map.

Single values have a focused editor with units, help and baseline comparison.
Small maps stay proportional to their contents, and the table/preview divider
can be dragged to resize it. See the [editor guide and screenshots](docs/editor/README.md).
The gallery's layout and MAF examples use synthetic values. Screenshots are not
tuning recommendations.

### Logging and recordings

[![SpeedLink recorded-log viewer with engine speed, boost, lambda and fuel-pressure plots](docs/logger/images/recorded-log.png)](docs/logger/README.md)

Record selected parameters to CSV, then review up to six synchronized plots
without an adapter. This preview uses synthetic example data; it does not show
a vehicle test or measured ECU logging rates.

## Edit a ROM

The Workbench keeps editing, logging and recordings in one window. **Fit map**
gives the table the available workspace. The app navigation collapses to icons;
the map browser and graph can be resized, hidden or moved into separate windows.
Use **View** for layout options, map information and changed maps. 3D tables can
keep a small surface preview at the upper-right of the grid; MAF curves keep
their value list on the left and graph on the right.
Axis names sit directly above the column breakpoints and beside the row
breakpoints. Selected row and column headers highlight together; value units
stay beside the map tabs. 3D maps carry labeled axis rulers and tick values
directly on their frame, aligned with the surface as it rotates.

1. Open **Editor**, then **File → Open ROM…**.
2. Select a map from the categorized list or use search. Related numbered maps
   are kept together. Each map opens in a tab with its units and tuner help.
3. For a single value, type in the field and choose **Apply value** or Enter;
   Cancel or Escape discards typing. For a table, double-click a cell or apply
   arithmetic, paste or interpolation to a selection. State controls use named
   choices. Compare with the original, last save or another compatible ROM;
   Undo/Redo restores operations. Review a curve or surface when available.
4. Choose **Save copy…**. Every save applies the ROM-specific checksum/integrity checks, then
   creates and verifies a new file; the original and existing copies are preserved.

Editing needs no adapter. Supported tuning profiles are **L33XEH000, L35HEH000,
L38KEH000, L39SED000, L39SEE000, L39SEF000, L3M7EF000, L3P4EM000 and L3CGEE000**. A matching calibration,
boot and program area are required. Patched/extended ROM layouts are unsupported.
Static axes are read-only. See the [editor guide](docs/EDITOR.md) for details.

Long MAF curves use a breakpoint/value list beside a zoomable curve. Click a
point to reach its value, including either end of a 129-point calibration.
Layout preferences are saved beside the EXE in `data/editor-layout.json`.

Select **Definitions** to import editor XML or logger JSON updates for supported
ROM layouts. Updates are kept in `data/definitions` beside the EXE; the bundled
copies remain available. See [definition import](docs/DEFINITIONS.md).

## Report a problem

Capture starts automatically before the adapter opens. After a problem, choose
**Connection → Export support report…**, select the failed session and save its
ZIP. You can do this after restarting without reconnecting. Follow the
[reporting guide](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) and attach it to the
[problem-report form](https://github.com/mrphyslaw/SpeedLink/issues/new?template=bug-report.yml).
Factory seed/key exchanges are retained; personal information is redacted and
ROM bytes stay in your backups.

## Read and back up a ROM

[Adapter status and testing candidates](docs/ADAPTERS.md) distinguishes available
adapter paths from hardware awaiting qualification.
**Mongoose-Plus ISO/CAN3** is available as an experimental J2534 reader/logger
option for user testing; hardware validation is pending. See the guide for
driver setup and reporting results.

**First time, or contributing an unknown ROM?** Follow the
[step-by-step ROM-dump workflow](docs/DUMP_A_ROM.md), then use the
[guided ROM-support request](https://github.com/mrphyslaw/SpeedLink/issues/new?template=rom-support.yml).

1. Download **SpeedLink.exe** from [Releases](https://github.com/mrphyslaw/SpeedLink/releases).
2. Save it in a writable folder and double-click it. No installer or .NET installation is needed.
3. Connect a **Vgate vLinker FS USB** or **Tactrix Openport 2.0** with its manufacturer's driver installed. Select the adapter in SpeedLink; vLinker also needs its COM port.
4. Turn the ignition on with the engine stopped, then select **Connect & identify**.
5. For an unknown Gen 2 ECU, select **Gen 2 read protocol (experimental)**; known ROMs choose automatically. Select **Read & verify backup**. SpeedLink saves a verified backup after two complete reads match.

![Backup progress showing the second read pass, overall percentage, bytes and estimated time remaining](docs/reading/images/progress.png)

The progress panel shows both passes, elapsed time and an estimate based on
measured read speed. It reaches 100% after verification and saving finish.
This screenshot uses a synthetic offline test; its timing is not a vehicle
read-speed measurement. [Progress and result screenshots →](docs/DUMP_A_ROM.md#3-read-and-verify)

Backups are saved in the `data` folder beside the EXE. Keep the whole backup
folder, including its captures, manifest and journal.

## Log engine data

You need a full backup of the ROM currently installed in the ECU. SpeedLink uses
it to choose the logging profile and read the MAP sensor calibration. The current
logger supports [nine defined ROMs](definitions/logging/All_ROM_Coverage.md).

1. Connect the adapter and select **Connect & identify**. If you just read a ROM,
   disconnect and reconnect before logging.
2. Open **Logger**, select **Load current ECU ROM…**, and choose that current ROM
   backup. Its calibration ID must match the connected ECU.
3. Choose **Essentials** for a starting selection, or select the parameters you
   need. Set each row's display unit. Fewer selected parameters allow faster updates.
4. Leave mixture readings in lambda, or enter your fuel's stoichiometric AFR
   before choosing an AFR display unit.
5. Leave **Record CSV** checked and select **Start logging**. Use the **Plot** column
   to choose up to six synchronized charts for logged parameters. The **Hz** column shows its measured sample rate;
   **Target scans/s** is a ceiling, not a guaranteed rate.
6. Select **Stop** to finish the recording and disconnect. Use **Open logs** to
   find it under `data/logs` beside the EXE. Reconnect before another logging session.

Logging can run with the engine running. **ROM backup reads require the engine
stopped.** Unknown ROMs can still be dumped; logging requires a supported profile.
See the [logger guide](docs/LOGGER.md) for setup, recordings and troubleshooting.

## Review a recording

1. Choose **Recordings** in the left navigation. No adapter is needed.
2. Select **Open recording…** and choose the recording folder's `log.csv`.
3. Select up to six parameters. Move the shared cursor or click a plot to inspect
   readings, and use **Zoom** to focus on part of the recording. Missing data appears
   as gaps; the viewer also shows sample ages and recorded rates.

Keep the whole recording folder, including `responses.jsonl` and `session.json`,
locally. Start troubleshooting with a [support ZIP](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md);
review any recording separately before deliberately sharing it.

## ROM checks

Known-ROM checks and checksum correction are available under **ROM checks**.
Checksum correction saves a separate file. Unknown ROMs do not need to pass these
checks to be read and saved.

See [ROM checks and compatibility](docs/SUPPORTED_ROMS.md) for the known layouts.
Related RomRaider definitions are available in [MazdaSpeedDefs](https://github.com/mrphyslaw/MazdaSpeedDefs).

## Status and development

**Current release: [v0.6.0-alpha.5](https://github.com/mrphyslaw/SpeedLink/releases/tag/v0.6.0-alpha.5), a Windows Workbench alpha.**

- **Available:** ROM reading, two-pass verified backups, known-ROM checks and
  checksum correction to a separate file; live logging, charts, CSV recording
  and saved-log viewing; offline ROM editing, comparison, 2D/3D views and undo/redo.
  The reader covers the 1 MiB MZR DISI ECU family.
- **Logger coverage:** eight Gen 1 profiles with 35–38 stock-ROM parameters each,
  plus experimental L3CGEE000 Gen 2 logging with 20 parameters.
  No logging patch is required. See [coverage and exclusions](definitions/logging/All_ROM_Coverage.md).
- **Fixed:** logger matching accepts known complete ECU calibration IDs, including
  `L3P4EM000L3T6051`. Renaming a ROM file is unnecessary.
- **Checked:** 426 C# tests and 2,384 native-derived logger vectors. Nine-profile
  editor checks cover direct cell entry, comparison, undo/redo and byte-identical
  no-edit exports. L3CGEE000 adds 379 native logger instruction checks and complete
  reference-ROM cell/axis comparisons. See [validation](docs/VALIDATION.md).
  Earlier physical logger tests passed with vLinker FS and Tactrix across the
  original seven Gen 1 profiles, including fault handling, sustained requests
  and USB recovery. Gen 2 adapter tests remain pending. Saved-log viewing and
  standalone EXE checks also passed.
- **Still pending:** real Mazda ECU read/logging acceptance, sensor readings and
  achievable vehicle logging rates. All 313 channel/profile ECU checks remain pending.
- **Planned:** ECU flashing. Live programming is disabled in this release.

Bench testing uses simulated ECU replies over real adapters. A matching pair of
ROM reads verifies consistency; it does not establish factory provenance or
compatibility with another vehicle. Unknown ROMs remain readable without a definition.
