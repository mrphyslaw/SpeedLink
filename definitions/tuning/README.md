# Bundled tuning definitions

These nine XML files are supported snapshots from the local MazdaSpeedDefs
repository, incorporated under its MIT license (LICENSE in this folder). They
are embedded into the executable. No ROM image or commercial software is bundled.

The first editor requires an exact definition identity, the existing SpeedLink
boot/checksum-layout checks and a program-area signature. Program signatures
cover the recognized program area with defined numeric controls, named switch bits and
the correction word masked out. Table edits remain supported; other program
modifications are rejected. SHA-256 signatures contain no ROM payload. Static axes are display metadata. A
BitwiseSwitch's sizex counts named bits within shared storage, not sequential
data elements. All named bits are exposed individually and neighboring bits
are preserved. See ../../docs/EDITOR.md for usage and current limits.

L3CGEE000 retains the supported native addresses and geometry. Its help clarifies
knock-reference arithmetic and encoded injector coefficients. Its code checksum
and four markers are validated on export without automatic code repair. Editable
calibrations are outside that sum; additional calibration integrity is unestablished.

Update these snapshots deliberately, retain the license, and rerun editor tests
and the local reference-ROM audit after definition changes.
