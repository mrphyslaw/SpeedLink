## Mandatory ROM-save integrity

- Every ROM exported from the editor must have a valid checksum before its final filename is
  published. Automatically recalculate and write every independently established
  correction word on every save, including saves without table edits.
- There must be no user option, imported-definition setting or alternate export
  path that bypasses checksum correction and verification. ROM exports must use
  `RomEditor.SaveNew`; verify both the prepared bytes and the durable file readback.
- Use the independently verified integrity policy for each ROM. Gen 1 profiles
  have an established additive correction word. L3CGEE000 calibration edits are
  outside its native code sum: verify the code sum and markers on every export,
  preserve valid code, and reject invalid code without inventing a repair word.
  Additional Gen 2 calibration integrity remains unestablished.
- Keep originals and existing exports intact. Failure must never publish an
  unchecked ROM or leave a successful-save state.
- Run `RomSaveIntegrityTests` for every bundled editor definition, plus the full
  regression suite, whenever editing or integrity behavior changes. New editable
  ROM profiles require an independently established integrity policy and inclusion
  in that test matrix. Tests must run without private ROM files or hardware.
- Raw ECU backups must preserve the captured bytes exactly. Apply checksum
  correction to editor exports; retain immutable original read captures.

ECU programming remains disabled. Do not publish ROM binaries, private research,
customer data, proprietary material or local evidence paths.
