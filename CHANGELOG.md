# Changelog

## 0.7.0-alpha.3

- Resize any map from its own edges or corners without moving or resizing the other maps. A lone map can fill unused space beside it. Manual resizing and title dragging allow overlapping panes; the active map comes to the front, and choosing a covered map in the browser reveals it.
- Preserve each pane's position and size when opening or closing other maps, docking back, resizing the workspace and reopening the same calibration. Scroll to reach panes in a smaller workspace. Tile and stack commands restore automatic arrangement. Native detachable windows remain available by dragging a title outside the workspace or choosing Undock.
- Add required nine-profile desktop checks for independent resizing, overlap, movement, pointer hit testing, cancellation, mixed scalar/table layouts and saved geometry. Keep readable text minimums, shared edits and mandatory ROM-save integrity unchanged.

## 0.7.0-alpha.2

- Handle unsupported, unknown, incomplete and invalid ROM files as recoverable editor errors. Keep the current ROM, unsaved edits, undo history and docked/detached maps intact after rejection; supported files can still be opened afterward. Program-layout and checksum protections remain enforced.
- Show single values and named states in small cards that wrap across the workspace, normally about 300 pixels wide. Use standard-size text and number fields, one baseline row, compact window commands, and Apply/Cancel only while typing. Keep full help behind the information button. Card widths, heights and popout sizes remain resizable and restorable.
- Label boost correction modes as Engine load and Boost pressure, with help explaining the target-versus-actual difference. Stored mode values are unchanged.
- Require nine-profile desktop regressions for file rejection and recovery, five simultaneous cards at two window sizes, browser-driven wrapping, width/height resizing, saved-size restoration, full help access, invalid input and shared edits. Retain all-profile save-integrity and existing editor regression checks.

## 0.7.0-alpha.1

- Open several maps together in resizable panes, with independent native Windows popouts. Expand and restore a map without closing other views. Each pane keeps its own graph, baseline, selection and text zoom over one shared ROM and undo history.
- Auto fit changes cell spacing without shrinking text. Measured displayed values set the minimum width; small windows scroll instead of clipping values. Deliberate text zoom is bounded to 85–150%. Compact maps and long MAF curves retain their specialized editors.
- Restore map layouts, split proportions, window bounds, selections, scrolling and graph views separately for each calibration when its ROM is opened. Pending invalid input blocks saving and closing its view; another pane cannot erase it.
- Add required nine-profile map-window desktop checks and Core readability/persistence cases. Retain all existing editor, logger, backup, integrity and standalone release checks. Update the editor guide and screenshots. ECU programming remains disabled.

## 0.6.0-alpha.6

- Keep floating map panels inside the Editor workspace and hide an empty floating graph until a graphable map is selected. Handle file permission errors without terminating the editor.
- Remember logger channels, units and plots separately for each ROM profile, including Gen 2 choices and changes made without starting a recording. Restore choices on launch without trusting an old ECU/ROM binding.
- Validate display settings before logging starts so invalid AFR input leaves the connection available. Explain the reconnect required after a ROM read with a direct Connection action.
- Refresh stopped chart statuses immediately. During a partial scan, retain fresh last-known values with an explicit pending age; clear expired or rejected data without changing recording or calculation freshness rules.
- Restore the prior recording and usable status if a replacement cannot be opened. Correct Gen 2 replay default-selection checks while retaining the six-plot limit.
- Correct diagnostic rotation byte accounting so full-size Windows logs export reliably. Developer reports use the current build identity and preserve primary results if support export fails.
- Add synthetic desktop lifecycle regressions for all nine profiles and full-size diagnostic export/failure checks to the required release workflow. ECU programming remains disabled; real ECU acceptance remains pending.

## 0.6.0-alpha.5

- Show the map browser whenever a ROM opens, including after restoring a hidden layout. Keep a visible Maps button and a clear map-selection prompt when no table is selected.
- Cover saved hidden layouts, closing the final map tab, and restoring minimized floating browsers in desktop regression checks for every supported ROM.

## 0.6.0-alpha.4

- Correct release source packaging to archive the complete repository from its root, including definitions, documentation and build resources.
- Verify every archive path and file against the exact source commit's Git blob hashes before release packaging can complete.
- Includes all alpha.3 crash reporting, CI evidence, automated releases and reviewed-maintenance improvements. Its source archive supersedes the incomplete dotnet-only archive in alpha.3.

## 0.6.0-alpha.3

- Capture unexpected application errors locally, offer reports on restart and export a crash support ZIP. Keep existing drafts and backups intact; no automatic uploads or memory/ROM dumps.
- Retain synthetic CI reports and screenshots for 14 days, bound check duration and cancel superseded branch runs.
- Build, test and publish the same standalone EXE through GitHub, with matching source, SHA-256 checksums, release identity and build provenance. Windows code signing remains pending.
- Propose weekly NuGet and pinned-action PRs, plus tested coupled SDK/runtime patches for review. No automatic merge or release.
- ECU programming remains disabled. No new physical adapter or real ECU acceptance is claimed.

## 0.6.0-alpha.2

- Rebuild the standalone EXE with the .NET 10.0.14 security update and SDK
  10.0.403. Refresh dependency locks with the pinned SDK.
- Pin the bundled runtime explicitly and require its exact version in the
  standalone startup check. Keep the Windows x86 build and installed-driver paths.
- Show the running .NET version in About. Replace the EXE to receive this update;
  preserve the existing `data` folder.
- Require automatic checksum correction and verification on every editor export,
  with no opt-out. Enforce prepared-byte and durable-readback integrity checks.
  Gen 2 native code validation rejects invalid code without guessed repair.
- Add an explicit contributor/agent requirement and mandatory save tests for every
  supported ROM, including repeated edits, no-edit saves and invalid input.
- ROM definitions, read/logging protocols and integrity policies are unchanged.
  ECU programming remains disabled; real ECU validation remains pending.

## 0.6.0-alpha.1

- Add experimental Gen 2 application reading, automatic known-family selection
  and an explicit protocol choice for compatible unknown Gen 2 ROMs.
- Add L3CGEE000 editing with 442 controls and mandatory native code/marker
  validation on save, without arbitrary code repair.
- Add a 20-parameter L3CGEE000 stock-ROM logger with exact reply checks,
  calibration binding and explicit unavailable channels.
- Record the read protocol in verified backup manifests and support diagnostics.
- Publish diagnostic storage failure state before flush callers resume.
- Update bundled Help, README, About and the Gen 2 validation guide.
- Native/offline and desktop checked; real ECU acceptance and logging values/rates
  remain pending. Production ECU programming stays disabled.

## v0.5.5-alpha.5 — logger calibration matching

- Recognize known complete ECU calibration identities as well as short software
  IDs, including L3P4EM000L3T6051. Fix the false ROM mismatch when loading a
  matching ECU backup for logging. The ROM filename does not affect matching.
- Keep unknown build suffixes, different profiles and ambiguous IDs rejected.
  Show the selected ROM profile and reported ECU calibration when they differ.
- Add full-identity regression checks across all eight profiles and exercise
  complete IDs in the desktop logger checks. Logger parameters and ROM editing
  definitions are unchanged; live ECU logging validation remains pending.

## v0.5.5-alpha.4 — L3P4EM000 editor and logger

- Add the 2006 Australian Mazda 6 MPS L3P4EM000 stock-ROM definition: 895 maps
  and controls, ROM identity/boot/program checks and mandatory checksum correction
  on export. Existing definitions remain available.
- Add 35 stock logger parameters with matching ROM code guards, MAP calibration
  bindings and 277 native-derived vectors. Three unavailable baseline parameters
  are excluded. Live ECU logging and rate validation remain pending.
- Extend the editor/logger/import checks and coverage checklist to eight profiles.

## v0.5.5-alpha.3 — backup progress

- Show prominent backup progress on Connection, including the current pass,
  bytes read, overall percentage, elapsed time and estimated time remaining.
- Estimate from measured transfer speed across both passes. Keep verification
  below 100% until the backup and its completion records have been saved.
- Retain the last progress on Stop or failure, clearly marked not verified.

## v0.5.5-alpha.2 — J2534 receive compatibility

- Preserve validated messages returned with timeout-like J2534 statuses instead
  of treating every such return as empty. Keep fatal errors and malformed replies
  fatal, bounded response waits and no automatic request resends.
- Use the complete reported ISO15765 message length and record inconsistent
  extra-data indexes rather than truncating the diagnostic reply.
- Include returned-message counts, timeout-with-data counts and native-call
  timings in support diagnostics. Mongoose hardware validation remains pending.

## v0.5.5-alpha.1 — diagnostic reports

- Capture persistent, bounded diagnostics before the adapter opens: setup,
  requests, timing, errors, J2534 receive statistics and factory seed/key access.
- Export a support ZIP with a readable preview and session picker, including
  failed sessions after restarting. Personal information is redacted; ROM bytes
  stay in backups. Keep backup journals unchanged and export a sanitized copy.
- Add a reporting guide in Help and a guided GitHub problem-report form.
- Retain read-only ECU access, existing deadlines and no automatic resends.

## v0.5.4-alpha.10 — updated user guides

- Reorganize the editor guide around first edits, single values, small tables,
  long MAF curves, selections, comparisons, layout and checksum-verified exports.
- Explain preview resizing, Fit map versus Fit view, Map info and shortcuts.
- Align the included Getting started and Logger help with workspace navigation.
- Refresh the documentation index, editor overview, About text and release status.
- Retain the existing editor, definitions and ECU-access behavior.

## v0.5.4-alpha.9 — single values and resizable previews

- Replace the one-cell grid with a dedicated value editor: units, explanation,
  baseline and change together, with Apply/Enter, Cancel/Escape, reset and Undo/Redo.
- Preserve full stored precision, reject invalid or unencodable values inline,
  retain invalid drafts, and commit valid drafts before saving or switching maps.
- Use the same focused layout for single-state selectors. Size small grids and
  multi-state controls to their contents, and improve short-curve preview labels.
- Make the right-hand table/preview divider draggable. Remember its width across
  launches and docking; Fit map restores the automatic compact preview.
- Retain complete 16×16 fitting, long MAF editing and mandatory checksum correction.
- Update the editor guide and screenshots. Definitions and ECU access are unchanged.

## v0.5.3-alpha.1 — table preview

- Keep a compact 3D preview at the upper-right of the map grid, using the same
  right-hand graph position and controls as the MAF editor.
- Retain the full table height and fit a complete 16×16 grid at both tested
  logical window sizes while the preview remains visible.
- Add Table with 3D preview to View and make it the Fit map view for surfaces.
  Popping the graph out and docking it restores the compact preview.
- Use an intake-cam VVT map with clear changes in height for 3D screenshots.
- Prevent scrollbars from keeping one another visible when fitting a table
  after opening or resizing on a narrow desktop.

## v0.5.2-alpha.1 — compact editor

- Collapse app navigation to icons and reduce the editor's top and bottom bars.
- Add Fit map, a resizable/hideable/floating map browser, floating graph and
  separate map-information window. Remember panel sizes, views and positions.

  1280×720 logical window sizes using Fit map with compact navigation.
- Display long MAF curves as breakpoint/value rows beside a curve with zoom,
  pan and linked point selection. Keep static breakpoints read-only.
- Keep full precision during cell editing and clipboard operations; support
  long-curve value-column paste and validated breakpoint/value paste.
- Fit the 3D surface to wide and tall panes. Preserve mandatory checksum saves.

## v0.5.1-alpha.1 — definition import

- Import editor XML and logger JSON updates through the Definitions window.
- Keep imported copies in `data/definitions`, with explicit replacement review,
  version/source details, bundled fallback and retained previous imports.
- Preserve open ROM edits during imports; apply updates when a ROM is next loaded.
- Reject unsupported layouts, protected storage, unrecognized logger requests
  and invalid files while retaining mandatory checksum verification on exports.

## v0.5.0-alpha.1 — Workbench UI

- Added a single-window workspace with vertical navigation and graphite/amber styling.
- Embedded the ROM editor and recording viewer; switching workspaces retains edits.
- Added Focused mode, four grid/graph layouts, collapsible map details and a changed-maps drawer.
- Added up to six live logger plots sharing a 30-second time axis and remembered plot selections.
- Editor saves always correct and verify the checksum; removed the checksum opt-out from the UI and save API.
- Added seven-profile Workbench UI checks and checksum-repair regression tests.
- ECU access remains read-only; real Mazda ECU validation remains pending.

## v0.4.0-alpha.1 — offline ROM editor

  selection arithmetic, spreadsheet clipboard, physical-axis interpolation,
  byte-exact undo/redo and reset to baseline.
- Saves create a new verified file, with checksum correction and original
  preservation. ECU programming remains disabled. No ROMs are bundled.
- Reject other program modifications with masked program-area signatures; retain
  unknown-ROM reading. Added synthetic editor desktop checks to CI.

## v0.3.0-alpha.2 — 2026-10-19

- Add a saved-log viewer with up to six synchronized plots, cursor inspection and zoom.
- Preserve recorded units, missing-data gaps and narrow peaks/dips during plot reduction.
